                    <p>My name is Jack and I am a full stack web developer.</p>
                    <p>I recently (Summer 2022) made a pivot to focus more on programming and development. I love learning and mastering new concepts and technologies, so, while challenging, learning in a more structured way about coding over the past few months has been very rewarding. Iâ€™m looking forward to see where this will take my in a professional capacity, and even more so looking forward to how I can employ these new skills for <strong>fun</strong> in my personal life!</p>
                    <p>Outside of coding, I love listening to, playing, and creating music, and spending time with my rescue dog, Kaya.</p>
